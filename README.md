## Ranks
_Developed by CodenameFlip_

This project was developed for ValiconNetwork, however mid-June the project was closed/abandoned and all of my projects whilst working there have been open sourced.
<br>
<br>
This plugin is designed to easily remove all permission nodes from the network and uses enums to verifiy rank permissions.
All ranks will sync between ALL servers running the plugin INSTANTLY using the database.

Yeah, you're right. Thats pretty cool B)
